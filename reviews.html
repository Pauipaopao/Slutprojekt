        <h2>The Midnight Library</h2>
        <img src="the-midnight-library-the-no-1-sunday-times-bestseller-and-worldwide-phenomenon.jpg">
        <p>The Midnight Library is a story about Nora Seed, a woman who wants to die.
         On the night she tries to commit suicide, she ends up somewhere between life and death — at The Midnight Library. 
         The green books in the vast library are the multitude of lives she could have lived and we follow her as she 
         navigates through these lives in hope of finding the best one. In hope of wanting to live again. 
         To me, this book will probably always be special because of the fact that I went and bought it on a rainy day 
         when I was feeling down. The beginning of the story felt heavy with hopelessness, but I kept reading 
         because I could tell things would get better for Nora. And thankfully, they did. Even if it wasn’t perfect, but 
         that’s the beauty of it all. This book made me think about the infinite possibilities in life such as the career paths 
         I could choose, the different places I could go and the people I could befriend. It made me happy and it made me sad, so 
         I’m very satisfied.</p>

        <h2>Nineteen, Twenty-One</h2>
        <img src="nineteen_twenty_one_1_1.jpg">
        <p>A short but incredibly sweet story containing romance, cats and flowers. 
        All amazing things. It was a nice and light read, and I enjoyed it very much. 
        “There are definitely things that kids can’t do, but adults can... But is it because they are adults?” 
        The story reminds you that simple kindness and understanding can be life changing.</p>

        <h2>The Museum of Heartbreak</h2>
        <img src=""> 
        <p>I was able to finish this book in a week, it’s easy to read. The main character was awkward and the 
            love interest was shabby, but that’s how they’re supposed to be. I found all characters uninteresting 
            and annoying (Audrey was the only tolerable one). I didn’t really become invested in their conflicts 
            and problems. However, I have to admit that the ending was satisfying. Overall it was a mediocre bok.</p>
