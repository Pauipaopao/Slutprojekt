        <h2>The Midnight Library</h2>
        <img src="the-midnight-library-the-no-1-sunday-times-bestseller-and-worldwide-phenomenon" style="width:100%">
        <p>The Midnight Library is a story about Nora Seed, a woman who wants to die.
         On the night she tries to commit suicide, she ends up somewhere between life and death — at The Midnight Library. 
         The green books in the vast library are the multitude of lives she could have lived and we follow her as she 
         navigates through these lives in hope of finding the best one. In hope of wanting to live again. 
         To me, this book will probably always be special because of the fact that I went and bought it on a rainy day 
         when I was feeling down. The beginning of the story felt heavy with hopelessness, but I kept reading 
         because I could tell things would get better for Nora. And thankfully, they did. Even if it wasn’t perfect, but 
         that’s the beauty of it all. This book made me think about the infinite possibilities in life such as the career paths 
         I could choose, the different places I could go and the people I could befriend. It made me happy and it made me sad, so 
         I’m very satisfied.</p>
